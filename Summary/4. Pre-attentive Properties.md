# Pre-attentive Properties

‍At this point, you learned how to create visualizations in Tableau. But, how do you create the **best** data visualization? A good visualization is one that uses "pre-attentive properties".

A pre-attentive visual property is one that sticks out from the remaining environment. The pre-attentive properties we will be discussing are **length**, **shape**, **color**, **size** and **position**.

Notice how all of these properties are quickly processed by your brain, and your brain easily focuses attention to differences in the properties without any conscious effort. As a data visualization creator, you can use these properties to your advantage to communicate your data in an easier, more intuitive way.

We will explain each property in some more detail and see how helpful they can be.
