# Filters

Filters allow the user to trim data from the view. Let's apply a filter to the time data worksheet.

To filter the visualization based on a field,Â **all you have to do is drag the field to the filter shelf, and let the magic happen.**

In this case, what if we didn't want to analyze the data over the entire span of the 4 years? We can apply a date filter by just dragging Order Date to filter.
