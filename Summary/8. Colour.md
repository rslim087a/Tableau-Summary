Differences in colour catch our attention very easily.

The choice of colour can be the difference between highlighting a stat, or alerting the viewer of poor performance.

The colour purple is simply highlighting, while the colour orange is pre-attentively processed as an alert.

Colour can also be used as a filter.

For example, we can use colour to show all the categories that have less than a desired number of sales, allowing us to quickly see our poor performing products.

Only use colour when it serves a true purpose. Typically, it is done to either highlight, alert, or filter.

Now that we've introduced colour as a pre-attentive property, and shown how useful it can be for highlighting the insights that you want to convey, let's move onto practical implementation and learn how to make use of colour in the context of Tableau.
