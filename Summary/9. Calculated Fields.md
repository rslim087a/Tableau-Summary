# **Calculated Fields**

As mentioned earlier, colour should not be used recklessly to simply make pretty visualizations, but rather it should aim to accomplish a certain task. In this section, we will use a calculated field to highlight a field of interest.

To do so, go to Analysis -> Create Calculated Field. Assign the field a name and call it **Highlighter.**

Assume the viewer was specifically interested in knowing how well the copiers are doing. In this case, colouring that sub-category will make it stand out. So, in our calculated field, we write:

`IF[SubCategory] = 'Copiers' THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END`

Basically, any-subcategory that isn't "Copiers" is categorized as `FALSE`, whereas "Copiers" is categorized as `TRUE`.

By dragging this calculated field to the colour mark, Tableau applies a categorical colour scheme. What's `FALSE` is displayed as blue, what's `TRUE` is orange, ultimately highlighting the category of interest.

However, what we have right now is very static. The user should have the ability to highlight any sub-category that they're interested in.
