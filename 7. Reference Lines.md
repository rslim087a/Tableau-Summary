‚ÄçReference lines can add a nice final touch to your visualization. They indicate a key value in your chart, with either a vertical or horizontal line.

Simply click on the analytics tab, and have the line span each pane of sheet 1.

There, this adds a nice touch to our plot! The positioning of the line effectively conveys to the viewer that overall, technology is far more profitable than other categories.
