# Tableau Implementation: Length and Position

**Length Implementation**
-------------------------

To make quantitative comparisons between categories, bar charts make the **best** use of length. Looking at this image, the discrepancy in length quickly reveals that technology is the most profitable category.

To generate this plot, drag Category and Sub-Category to rows, and Profit to columns. This will aggregate the sum of profit over each sub-category.

Purely through length we can quickly deduce that products in technology are by far most profitable.

This plot also reveals that a hierarchy exists between category and sub-category fields, since every category contains its own **unique **set ofsub-categories. If you were to further inspect the datasource, you'd notice that every sub-category also contains its own **unique **products.

We can declare this hierarchy in tableau by selecting these fields -> right click -> hierarchy -> create hierarchy, and call it Categories.

Make sure that your fields show up in an appropriate order. Since one category contains many sub-categories, which contains many products; make sure that the fields show up in that order.

This is useful because now we can simply drag the hierarchy to columns. As you click the **⊕ **symbol, Tableau drills down into the hierarchy and increases the granularity of the profit sum calculation.

As you click the ⊖ symbol, Tableau drills up into the hierarchy and decreases the granularity of the profit sum calculation

**Position Implementation**
---------------------------

In relevance to the position pre-attentive property, we can drag parts of our view to different positions and sort the bars from most profitable, to least profitable.

This allows the viewer to easily rank among the categories.
